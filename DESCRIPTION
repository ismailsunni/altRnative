Description: This package enables you to run your R code on different R implementation (e.g. Microsoft R Open) and platforms (e.g. Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch Linux).
    It will run your code on a docker container, thus you need docker installed in your system. Moreover, you can run a benchmark for your code to on supported R implementations and platform to see which one is the fastest.
